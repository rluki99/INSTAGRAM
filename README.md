## Project Description

The Instagram clone project aims to replicate some of the core functionalities of the popular social media platform. While it doesn't include all the features present in the original application, it serves as a minimal viable product (MVP) that focuses on key functionalities.

The project consists of two main pages: the timeline page and the profile page. On the timeline page, users can view images posted by the people they follow. The profile page allows users to view images from a specific profile they are currently searching for.

The following features have been implemented in the application:

1. Authentication: Users can create an account or log in to access the app's functionalities.
2. Image Upload: Users can upload their own images to share with others.
3. Image Viewing: Users can view images posted by other users, including those they follow.
4. Follow Functionality: Users can follow other users and have people follow them.

Please note that certain features commonly found in Instagram, such as chat, liking, comments, and stories, have been excluded from this project to focus on the core functionalities. However, with a solid understanding of the concepts covered in this course, you should be able to implement these additional features with some additional research.
